    qus: "What process does game development involve?",
    ans: `The game development process has three phases:
  <br/>
  <u>Prototype stage:</u>
  <br/>
  The designer translates the concept plan into a detailed design document describing the game's general purpose and what needs to be established.
  After everything is specified and documented, the programmer decides what code, software, engine, and technology to use.
  <br/>
  <u>The actual production of the game:</u>
  <br/>
  Start developing game modules. Use Scrum methodology and Scrum principles to prioritize the most critical parts and move to sprints too early. Start creating art assets, backgrounds/environments, animations, and visual effects. We review each sprint, work on feedback, optimize, test, and integrate every module.
  <br/>
  <u>Post-production:</u><br/>
  Post-production includes patching post-game bugs and working on post-game content. Post-production work includes developing in-game patches and downloadable content.`,
