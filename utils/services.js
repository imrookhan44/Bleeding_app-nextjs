This is the process typically used by mobile games that require a lot of animations. Animation has been a significant aspect of mobile games throughout the history of mobile game development. Our animators create a basic skeleton, model different poses, and manipulate the bones in different parts and directions to mimic movement. This is one of the traditional animation techniques. An artist creates a character image, and then the team creates different poses for the character in each frame, along with particle animation. Our 2D frame animators are highly skilled in making this animation process a breeze.",
